# back-chang


This is a simple React application that allows users to change the background color of the screen by clicking on different color buttons.

## Features

- **Dynamic Background**: Users can select from a variety of colors (Red, Black, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue) to instantly change the background color of the entire screen.
- **Centered Text**: A message, "HII this side Anjali," is displayed at the center of the screen, maintaining its position regardless of the background color.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout is responsive and ensures that the color buttons remain accessible at the bottom of the screen on different device sizes.
